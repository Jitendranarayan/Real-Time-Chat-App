# Getting Started with Create React App
Real-Time Chat App
Overview:

The project aims to provide a platform where users can send and receive messages in real time. Users should be able to create chat rooms, join existing ones, and exchange messages with other users in the same room. The backend services will be hosted on Firebase, and users will authenticate with their Google accounts.



The application should have the following features:

1. Google User Authentication: Users should be able to log in and log out using their Google accounts via Firebase Authentication.

2. Chat Rooms: Users should be able to create, join, and leave chat rooms.

3. Real-Time Messaging: Messages sent by users should appear in the chat room in real time.

4. Message History: The chat application should store the history of messages for each chat room, which should be visible to users when they join the room.

5. Private Messaging: Users should be able to send private messages to other users.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
